# 👋 Hi, I’m Frank Mendez  

🚀 **Software Engineer | NextJS | Typescript **  
Senior Software Engineer with over 11 years of experience building scalable, production-grade systems that balance user experience, performance, and maintainability. I approach problems from an engineering perspective focusing on architecture, trade-offs, and long-term impact rather than just shipping features.

My work spans full-stack system design, open-source contributions, and technical leadership, delivering reliable digital products across diverse environments. I have strong hands-on experience with Node.js, React, Next.js, and Supabase, backed by a frontend foundation that informs pragmatic backend and system decisions.
